# PRIVACY POLICY – REAL SHUFFLE

**Last updated:** December 1, 2025

## Application Description

Real Shuffle ("the App") is a third-party application that functions as a client for Apple Music and uses Apple's API (MusicKit) to play content from your music library.

## Information We Collect

Real Shuffle does not collect, store, or sell personally identifiable information outside of your device.

The App may access:

- Your Apple Music library and playlists
- Basic song information (title, artist, album, artwork), exclusively to display and play your music within the App

This information is obtained through Apple's services and is processed locally on your device.

## Use of Information

The information accessed by the App is used solely for:

- Displaying your music library and playlists
- Playing songs using Apple Music
- Generating random playback orders independent of Apple Music's algorithm

Real Shuffle does not send your library or playback data to its own servers or third-party servers.

## Third-Party Services

Real Shuffle uses Apple's services (Apple Music / MusicKit). Your use of the App is also subject to Apple's privacy policies and terms of service. We recommend reviewing Apple's privacy policy for more information.

## Data Storage

The App does not maintain its own servers to store your personal information. Any data related to your Apple Music account is managed and stored by Apple.

## Minors

Real Shuffle is not specifically directed to children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the beginning of this document. Continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.
